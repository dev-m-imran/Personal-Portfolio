              This was the First project I made when I started front end
              development. I used only HTML and CSS for this. I was asked to
              make a spotify login page using HTML and CSS. I use flex box
              prpoerty only one time.

            <h3>CSS Login Page</h3>
            <hr >
            <p>
              I chose this project by searching from google to understand the
              form tag in HTML and How to style them. I just took a screenshot
              of that page and made it. Here I also practiced grid box and flex
              box properties. Most of the buttons/checkbox might not work.

              This project was given to me by a friend. He challenged me and
              asked me to build a project similar to what he showed and guess
              what I made it. Actually it's not the exact copy but I tried to
              build what I know at that time. This is also non-responsive
              design.

              This is my first ever responsive webpage. This was given to me by
              a mentor of me during learning front-end development. I was given
              with the images of desktop and mobile version that I have to make
              and with some logos.
